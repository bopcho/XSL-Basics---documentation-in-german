# XSL-Basics---documentation-in-german

I was assigned to write a simple and comprehensive documentation in german for new workers at the company and since I'm not using any private data in my examples, I am free to share it with everybody.
This is the language I primarly used in my first coding job in Output Managment and Spooling for developing logic. 
I worked as an extern on private documents, therefore none of them are pushed on here.
